  <h3>Welcome to our Sentiment Analysis Tool</h3>
  <p>Get an insight into the opinions expressed in restaurant reviews on TripAdvisor! Our algorithm examines the language used in each review, assigning a polarity score to determine the sentiment expressed. After that, because polarity scores have limited interpretations, we do a sentiment analysis.<p>

        <p>In this analysis, we aim to understand if the sentiment score truly represents the user ratings. If we find that sentiment scores accurately reflect the reviews, then sentiment analysis would not be necessary. On the other hand, if this is not the case, the relationship between sentiment scores and ratings is ambiguous:</p>
        <p>- The ratings may not be representative enough of the comments: user reviews contain much more information and nuances than ratings can capture. Furthermore, people have different rating scales: one person who rates 4 may not have the same criteria as another person who rates 4 for the same restaurant! In this sense, for the same rating, sentiment scores can be very different!</p>

Here, we see that the majority of ratings have sentiment scores centered around 0. This indicates that sentiment scores alone may not accurately reflect the ratings given by users. This could be due to various reasons such as users having different rating scales or the limited information that a sentiment score can capture compared to the detailed information expressed in a review. Only very positive reviews seem to be well transcribed, as they are distinguishable from the rest with a distinct distribution around 0.5. It's important to note that sentiment scores have limitations, as they do not take into account the specific context of the review or terms used. They are different from advanced methods like Doc2Vec and BERT-type embeddings which consider the context.

        <p>Among the different models tested (whether on a text embedded by TFIDF or Doc2Vec), everything seems to indicate that the SVM is a relevant model with an accuracy of 0.7. In addition, the confusion matrices also reveal that the model classifies well. It's worth mentioning that the goal of this sentiment analysis was to accurately understand the emotions of the users, rather than simply providing a rating. What do you think?</p>

    <p>    - Type of food: Perhaps some types of food are relatively more appreciated by our users such as typical French cuisine<p>\
    <p>    - Location: regardless of the audience (international or local), some places are more famous for their cuisine. Typically, in areas such as Op√©ra, restaurants are numerous and mostly renowned. Is this remarkable?<p>\
